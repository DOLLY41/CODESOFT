# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP TASKS 
TASK-1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
 
 
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and create an accurate classification model that predicts survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic.

TASK-2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
 
 
 The objective of this project is to analyze historical movie data and develop a predictive model that estimates movie ratings based on features such as genre, 
 director, and actors. The goal is to apply regression techniques for accurate rating prediction, exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and 
 machine learning modeling techniques, while gaining insights into the factors that influence movie ratings.
 
 TASK-3: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
 
 
 The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the category of Iris flower based on dataset downloaded from the 
 Kaggle website as per Codsoft instructions for this project.
 In this project, I have implemented multiple classification algorithm with Python and Scikit-Learn. Accuracy of the model is calculated 
 and established with the help of Evaluation Metrics.
